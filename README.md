# Armonia-Prismatica
Armonía Prismática web site.
This is the Web site of a transmedia narrative, named Armonía Prismática.
This is a proyect made by begginers, so any suggestion is well received, i'm sorry for the messy code.
In this proyect we used HTML5, CSS4, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
By the way, the content is in spanish.
I'm sorry for any misspelling here.
